            <h2><b>Motivate your study choice</b></h4>
                <p>When I was twelve years old I moved in with my foster father who had his own IT company. He made
                    websites
                    and
                    hosted websites for clients from his home. I played a lot of computer games at the age of 12-16, and
                    I
                    wanted
                    to make my own game, so I started learning myself programming via youtube videos but that didn't
                    work
                    out the way I wanted. So by following this course I hope to understand proramming a bit more and
                    eventually being able to make my own game. I already have a bit of an idea of what kind of game I
                    want
                    to make, so when I have enough knowledge I hope I can realise my idea some day.</p>

            <h2><b>Study choice activities</b></h4>
                <p>I didn't do many study choice activities. I just had a big interest in doing a ICT study, so I looked
                    around if there were any schools that offered this study who are close by home. When I looked at the
                    closest schools in the area with this study, I saw the HZ, and that school seemed the closest but
                    also a lot of fun when I looked at their website.</p>

            <h2><b>After completing this study...What then?</b></h4>
                <p>When I have completed this study I want to work somewhere, but I don't know where exactly yet. I'm
                    hoping by doing an internship or at the end of the study I will get to know the different sides of
                    ICT and specialise myself in
                    one of the many areas. I'd like to learn how to use different programs like Unity, or different
                    programming languages like C++.</p>
